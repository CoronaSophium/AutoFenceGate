# AutoFenceGate
No more accidentally dismounting your horse while trying to open a fence gate.

1. Walk towards, open fence gate
2. Walk through, close fence gate

I made this mod out of a random necessity I personally encountered while playing Stardew Valley and learning C# and Stardew Valley modding. Turns out, however, there's another mod out there that accomplishes the same thing: `AutoGate` by Teban100/eroticremix [[Nexus Mods](https://rd.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/820/?) - [Forums](https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/autogate-automatically-opening-closing-gates.129074/)]. Whoops. Other than `AutoGate`'s lack of a config, the two mods are pretty much the same in functionality. I have yet to make any comparisons in performance or timings, however.

## Config
Checkout `Stardew Valley/Mods/AutoFenceGate/config.json` for mod configuration:
- \<bool\> `onlyWhileRidingHorse`: activate automatic fence gate mechanics only while riding a horse
- \<float\> `maxStayOpenDistance`: max distance from player to keep the fence gate open
