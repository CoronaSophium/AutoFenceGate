# Passage
Ever wish for Pokemon-styled walk-through warp doors, or fence gates that can sense you approach--you know--like those grocery store sliding doors or vicious predators stalking some prey?

Features
---
- Automatic fence gate opening/closing:
    * Only messes with fence gates that are closed when you approach them
- Automatic door interaction -- works with all (tested) forms of doors
- Addition of a tiny, transluscent ghost that hurriedly closes fence gates behind you

Installation
---
1. Install [SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases/latest) (tested using SMAPI v2.1)
2. Download Passage's latest release from [here](https://github.com/CoronaSophium/Passage/releases/latest), and extract it to `Stardew Valley/Mods`
*_(optional)_*
3. Launch Stardew Valley with SMAPI once to generate Passge configuration file
4. Edit `Stardew Valley/Mods/Passage/config.json` to your heart's content

AutoFence
---
I made this mod out of a random necessity I personally encountered while playing Stardew Valley and learning C# and Stardew Valley modding. ~~Turns out, however, there's another mod out there that accomplishes the same thing: ~~`AutoGate` by Teban100/eroticremix [[Nexus Mods](https://rd.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/820/?) - [Forums](https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/autogate-automatically-opening-closing-gates.129074/)].

I've rewritten the mod since its initial release and renamed it from "AutoFenceGate" to "Passage". While AutoFenceGate and AutoFence used to share 100% of their features (bar any configuration differences), Passage now _also_ supports auto-interaction with doors.
